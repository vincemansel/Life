/* * File: lifeGraphics.h * Modified Fri Sep 29 12:30:59 PDT 2006 jzelenski * ----------------------------------------------- * Defines simple drawing routines for a 2-d grid of circles, * designed for use in the Life assignment. */#ifndef _lifegraphics_h#define _lifegraphics_h/* * Constant: MaxAge * ---------------- * We only have a fixed number of density levels to show * the progression of age. At age 1, a cell is a solid dot, * and each subsequent age is fainter. At age MaxAge and beyond,  * the same very faint pattern is used. */const int MaxAge = 12;/* * Function: InitLifeGraphics * Usage: InitLifeGraphics(10, 25); * -------------------------------- * This will erase the graphics window completely and draw a black * border around the simulation rectangle which is centered in the * window.  The grid cells will be sized as large as will fit given * the grid geometry. Grids with more rows and columns will use smaller  * cells and vice versa. This function can be used at the beginning of  * a simulation or between generations to clear the window before drawing  * the next generation. */void InitLifeGraphics(int numRows, int numCols);/* * Function: DrawCellAt * Usage: DrawCellAt(5, 0, 2); * --------------------------- * Draws the cell at the specific row and col, replacing any previous * cell at that location.  The grid geometry must have earlier been  * configured with the InitLifeGraphics function above. Rows and columns  * are specified using zero-based indexing and (0,0) is the upper-left corner.   * If the location given is not in bounds, an error is raised. * At startup, a random color is chosen for the simulation.  Each cell  * will be displayed in a shade which tells its age.  Cells that have just  * been born (i.e. that have value 1) are the darkest, they get lighter with  * age as the values go to 2, 3, and so on.  The cells stabilize as very faint  * at generation MaxAge and older.  Passing 0 for age means the cell is not alive, * the cell is drawn in white, erasing any previous contents. */void DrawCellAt(int row, int col, int age);#endif
